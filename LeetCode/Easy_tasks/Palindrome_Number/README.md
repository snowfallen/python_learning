Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a `palindrome` , and `false` otherwise.

Palindrome
***
An integer is a __palindrome__ when it reads the same forward and backward.

For example, `121` is a palindrome while `123` is not.

### Example
```
Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
